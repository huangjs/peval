* goal

** extensibility

   add new passes easily

** abstraction

   combine multiple passes to a new pass

** composable

   each pass should produce valid programs
   
** data-driven

   e.g. transformation rules
   - special transformation cases
   - no transformation cases
   - general cases

   e.g. passes composition

** warn possible problems of transformation 

   e.g. side-effect

** easy debugging

   able to check result for each passes

** avoid code bloating
