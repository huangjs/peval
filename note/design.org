* goal

** extensibility

   add new passes easily

** abstraction

   combine multiple passes to a new pass

** composable

   each pass should produce valid programs
   
** data-driven

   e.g. transformation rules
   - special transformation cases
   - special non-transformation cases
   - general cases

   e.g. passes composition

** warn possible problems of transformation 

   e.g. side-effect

   - incompatible forms

** easy debugging

   able to check result for each passes

** avoid code bloating

* design

** replace variables as placeholder

** before macro-expansion passes, after macro-expansion passes
