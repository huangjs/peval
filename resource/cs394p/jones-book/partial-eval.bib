systematic investigation of the effect of CBN CPS in connection with partial

First, we give a concrete example of the use of the CBN
CPS translation as a binding time improvement to achieve the effects
of deforestation using standard partial evaluation. The same effect cannot
be achieved with CBV CPS. Second, we prove
formally that the CBN CPS translation in conjunction with partial
evaluation has the power to achieve all
the effects of deforestation. The
consequence of these results is a practical tool (the CBN CPS) for
improving the results of partial evaluation, as well as an 
improved understanding of the relation between partial evaluation and deforestation."}
